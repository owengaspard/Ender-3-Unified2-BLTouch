# Ender-3 Unified 2.0

This is my own configuration for my Ender-3 (Creality 4.2.2) with a CRTouch (the exact same as a BLTouch in software). Please note that just becaue it works for me does NOT mean that it will work for you.

## Where to download and how to use it

You can download the base Unified 2 firmware from [TH3D's official site](http://uf2.th3dstudio.com).

My configuration is in the `Firmware` folder. You can edit `Firmware/Marlin/Configuration.h` and compile it, or (**NOT RECOMMENDED**) you can check `Firmware/.pio` for my build which is **NOT** at all garunteed to work with your printer and configuration.

**This is ONLY tested for use with VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. Arduino IDE is not tested or supported.**

## Credits

TH3D Unified 2 Firmware is built on top of Marlin 2 Firmware. Please donate to their dev team if you wish to make a donation. This project is done by TH3D Studio LLC to provide the 3D printing community with easy to use firmware and also enable ease of use with our products and other products on the market. Profits from our store allow our technical team to make projects like this available for free to the community.

## Firmware License

Marlin and Unified 2 Firmware is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

## STL File License

Some STL files are licensed to only TH3D customers and not permitted for re-distrubution by other individuals or companies. License files are accompanied in the ZIP file/folder for STL files that have a separate license.
